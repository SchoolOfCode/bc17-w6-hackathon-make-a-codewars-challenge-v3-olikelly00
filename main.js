/**
Hello challenger! 

Your task is to write a function named `findFactorial` which takes in a number and returns the factorial of that number.

What is a factorial? It is the product of all the numbers between the input number and 1. 

A few examples:

    `findFactorial(3)` should return 6 as 1 x 2 x 3 = 6
    `findFactorial(8)` should return 40320 as 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 = 40320

Simple, right?! But keep in mind the following edge cases:

    1) If someone inputs a negative number, the function should return an error with the following string: 'input must be a positive integer'.

    2) If someone inputs a 0, the function should return the correct factorial for 0, which is 1. 

    3) If someone inputs a float, the function should return an error with the following string: 'input must be a positive integer'.

    4) If someone inputs a non-number (eg. a string, boolean) into the function, an error should be thrown with the following string 'input must be a positive integer'.
  

Good luck!
